        Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of
        Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened 
        wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other 
        ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.) 
        which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
        A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. In Italy, pizza served in formal
        settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is eaten with 
        the use of a knife and fork. In casual settings, however, it is cut into 
        wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. The term pizza was first recorded
        in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of 
        Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.Modern pizza was invented in Naples,
        and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.It has 
        become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in 
        Europe and North America, available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),
        restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery. Many 
        companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.
        The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) 
        is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims 
        to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan 
        pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed 
        dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible 
        cultural heritage.
