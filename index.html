            A hamburger (also burger for short) is a sandwich consisting
            of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, 
            placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried,
            grilled, smoked[1] or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, 
            lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, 
            mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or "special sauce"; and are frequently placed on 
            sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.

            Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish 
            of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened 
            wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other 
            ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.) 
            which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. 
            A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
